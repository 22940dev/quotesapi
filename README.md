# quotesapi
Random Quotes generator Machine / API 

This is a Random Quoutes Generator API, Developed in Node.js. I am maintaining a json file named `quotes.db` which is working like a database to get the Random Quote. 

## How to Fork ?

- Fork the Repo / Download the Repo

** If you want to contribute to Node.js part than **

- You need to have latest Node.js in your System [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- After that just Open the folder and write this.

```
node index.js
```
it will be live on `http://localhost:3000`

** If you want to Add Quotes **

Than just Add the New quote in json format at the end of `quotes.db`

```
{
    "quote": "Be as you wish to seem.",
    "author": "Socrates"
}
```

Thankyou.
